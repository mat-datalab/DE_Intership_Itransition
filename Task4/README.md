Each directory contains a Jupyter notebook responsible for processing and analyzing the data. The notebooks walk through the entire workflow step by step, from loading the data, through transformation, to producing the final results.

Additionally, every folder includes an Excel file that contains all final processed values generated during the analysis. This file serves as a summary of the notebook’s output and can be used independently.
